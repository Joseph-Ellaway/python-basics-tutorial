Sometimes, this will be checking whether two things are equal, whether the result of some calculation meets a requirement or simply checking if an outcome is true. Python's conditional statements match those of many other programming languages, so the conditions you learn here will be applicable throughout your programming journey. \n","\n","Let's begin by thinking about how a condition works in programming. Essentially, we write a statement in code that checks if something is either true or false. If the condition is true, then the block of code below is executed. If the condition is false, the block of code is skipped and the program continues as if nothing happened. \n","\n","Below is an example of a conditional statement in Python3.
